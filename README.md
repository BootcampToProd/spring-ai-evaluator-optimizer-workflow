# Spring AI - Evaluator Optimizer Workflow Pattern

This repository demonstrates the **Spring AI Evaluator Optimizer Workflow Pattern**, a powerful self-improving AI system that creates high-quality output through iterative refinement. The pattern uses two specialized LLM roles - a "Generator" (Writer) to create initial content and an "Evaluator" (Editor) to critique and guide improvements until the output meets predefined quality standards.

ðŸ“– **Dive Deeper**: For a complete walkthrough, detailed explanations of the Evaluator Optimizer Workflow pattern, and step-by-step instructions for building the example application, read our comprehensive blog post.<br>

## About This Project

This project implements a **Smart Email Generator** as a real-world example of the Spring AI Evaluator Optimizer Workflow. It showcases how to:

*   Set up a Spring Boot application with Spring AI and Google Gemini integration.
*   Implement the `EmailEvaluatorOptimizer` workflow with recursive improvement loops.
*   Create specialized AI personas through carefully crafted system prompts for Writer and Editor roles.
*   Build a complete REST API for professional email generation with quality assurance.
*   Handle iterative refinement with safety limits and comprehensive error handling.

The application generates professional emails (job follow-ups, raise requests, etc.) that are automatically refined through multiple rounds of AI-powered editing until they meet strict quality criteria, including a 80-word limit for conciseness.
